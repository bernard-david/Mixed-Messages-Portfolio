# Mixed Messages Project

This project is a message generator that randomly selects words and includes them into a message template similar to a [Mad Libs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs "Mad Libs - Wikipedia"). The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my knowledge of Javascript, Git and GitHub, and the Command Line.

## Technologies

* Javascript
* VS Code
* Command Line
* Git
* Node.js

## Launch

* Node.js

## Project Guidelines

Project orginates from Codecademy's Full Stack Developer course

> For this project, you will build a message generator program. Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output. Youâ€™re welcome to take the project in a couple of different forms, like an astrology generator, inspirational message, or nonsensical jokes. To make your program truly random, the message that it outputs should be made up of at least three different pieces of data. Take what you know of JavaScript syntax so far to build the program and customize it to your liking.

## Message Template

Below is the message used in the program. The program will randomly select a word corresponding to a noun, verb, verb ending in -ing, and a number from a word bank. 

*They say that to properly (verb) a (noun) you must first begin by (verb ending in -ing) it. Well, I must say that I tried this (number) time(s). All I got was a (noun).*
